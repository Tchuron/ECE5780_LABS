Test to make sure that we are actually blocking in the buffer. 
	-test for filling up buffer and test for simultaneous access

When the sum is > 100 synchronized termination.

(Look at the Synchronization part)


Errors/Questions:
	-Generator not visible
	-Hidden Declaration: A_Random_Int
	-Are there issues with a random float and random discrete in the same program?
	-Should we use a subtype or can we use a float and convert to an integer?
	-Should F1 F2 and F3 be in the same program as Part 6?
